            <h3>Michael LeBron</h3>
            Born in 1990 into a family of 12, Michael was the youngest child.<br>
            Growing up it was hard for him to get any attention from his parents.<br> 
            That was until highschool when he started gathering attention from everyone<br>
            around from his imense basketball talents. His freshman year he averaged 50<br> 
            points a game.<br>
                In 2005, instead of returning to highschool for his sopomore season, he<br>
            decided to enter the NBA draft where he would be the youngest number 1 pick<br>
            of all time. At 15 years old, Michael LeBron would lead the Seattle Supersonics<br>
            to their first and only championship as they were sold the following season<br>
            to an Oklahoma City business man. <br>
                Averaging 30 points a game in the finals and<br>
            winning finals MVP, Michael LeBron decided that basketball was too easy<br>
            and he would return to school to get an education. From that point on<br>
            his life is no longer exciting or worth making up so the biography ends here.<br>
